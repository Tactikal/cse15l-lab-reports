## Questions
1. I think that it would require a more involved change, since none of the links are being parsed correctly. The `MarkdownParse.java` file may require a more refined alogorithm for detecting all the links, which is likely to require more than 10 lines of code.
2. Since both tests passed, I think `MarkdownParse.java` is working as intended when handling this test case. However, I would make sure that it works for similar cases, so a small change in the code may be necessary.
3. Similar to snippet 2, I think `MarkdownParse.java` is working as intended when handling this test case. However, I would make sure that it works for similar cases, so a small change in the code may be necessary.
